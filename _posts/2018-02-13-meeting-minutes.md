- Byte-le Royale
    - Reflection
        - 36 people
        - Well:  
            - Updates
                - Communication during event was good
                - Planning went well
                - When needed, they rolled out well
            - Art style
                - People liked Smoking Stone and Business Minotaur
                - Visualizer well liked (built from scratch)
            - Design Elements
                - Pikeman did what we wanted to it
                - Updates were necessary for the game, and helped it
                - Variety of traps to go against and monsters to fight
                - If you noticed all the small things, it added up
                - Forced to reference documentation versus forming algorithms
            - Communication:
                - Issues and bringing up Qs and As
                - Bugs fixed when needed
                - Documentation went well and laid out good
            - Sign-ins
                - went swimmingly
                - Location
            - Spreading out for EC members
                - Kept in a spot for people to see and talk
                - Many questions were answered from all
                - PyCharm session was helpful
            - Python choice
                - new language for people to use
                - easy to config or teach
                - good installer
            - FOOD TICKETS
                - 2/3 of people purchased
                - near perfect spending
                - great distribution when it happened
                - Goodie bags supplied for as long as people kept them (good value out of them too!)  

        - Meh:
            - Room Usage by Outsiders
                - One room was inhabited by someone, so food had to be separate room
            - Python installations
                - few outliers that postponed others from updates
                - MAC users may require additional support earlier 
            - Where people would be
                - Try to get more centralized at 116, 114, and 132
                - Otherwise, let people know where the EC members would regularly be for most of the time

        - Could be better:
            - Meta adjustments
                - Updates came late and errors or other weird bits coming in after a few hours
            - Team setup
                - Know who is on what team
                - Ease of adding future clients
            - Usage of ACM and assets
                - Meant to be staging area but potential non-event organizers in area caused lack for discussion
                - Don't do something for a single person unless EVERYONE can utilize the space and assets equally
            - TA Office usage
                - Try to keep it for a designated nap room or other public area (door MUST be open, keep quiet around the area)
            - Forum
                - max people on at once was about 1/4 of total competitors
                - Try and push people to check all communication channels
                - Find a potential better use than PHPBB
            - People knowing about updates
                - Try as we would, people wouldn't know about the updates
                - Have people pull regularly in the future?
            - Rules?
                - For a first event, went well, BUT ensure any gray questions are asked
            - Answering Questions:
                - Make sure people write documentation to know what goes on in-game
                - Clarify what is meant to be and what could happen
                - Let others know the answers beforehand
                - Go over (with a potential other non-competitor) the documentation and see what they see is wrong
            - Some traps:
                - Puzzle Box (Murder box) and the Sphinx (slooowdown) 
                - Intent wasn't what was shown
                - Early enough to cause lasting effect
                - Make sure each update has 2 people verifying the effect and that it works as intended  

        - New Ideas:
            - Stream visualizers so people can view without going into separate room?
                - needs of more computers to do it
                - more complexity
            - Staging server for testing
                - Test updates before pushing to everyone
                - Ensure variation from 
            - More fundraising options for Byte-le Royale
                - from corporate sponsorships?
                - from other people or outsiders?
- Transfer the lesson from this year to next year
    - Those who come after will have their ideas of what went well vs what could improve
    - Keep the ideas of old and
