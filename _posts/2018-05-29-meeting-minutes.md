# What We're Going Over:- New ACM room# What We Went Over:  - Discussion on deciding where to move our ACM room    - General agreement towards 204B. Planning where everything goes in the new room will be difficult, as nothing can block the two windows or the three doors, while still fitting sitting space, whiteboards, arcade machine, and everything. Interior windows    - Interest in room 250, good size and gigabit connection, would be very difficult to get. However, there are no windows.    - Room 424 is an option, except the room is very difficult to get to, and fourth floor is a maze in itself. The room is bigger than the other options, but is currently divided into smaller sub-offices.    - 204B is our most likely decision- Moving to the new room will take place sometime over the summer- No news on graphic cards or chairs- Preliminary plan for next meeting on Tuesday at 8:30pm- Bank Account - $509.74 # To Accomplish By Next Meeting:  - Mail Eric's check- Remind Email to Nygard# Next Meeting:- ACM room
